ArchVelo is a method for modeling gene regulation and inferring cell trajectories using single-cell simultaneous chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) and transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) profiling. ArchVelo represents chromatin accessibility as a set of archetypes---shared regulatory programs---and models their dynamic influence on transcription. As a result,  ArchVelo improves inference accuracy compared to previous methods and decomposes the velocity field into components, each potentially corresponding to a specific regulatory program.

This repository contains the ArchVelo package. A demonstration of ArchVelo on a scRNA+ATAC-seq dataset for the mouse embryonic brain can be found in the ArchVelo_demo.ipynb notebook.

Notebooks for the full ArchVelo analysis on the mouse embryonic brain, human hematopoietic stem cells and CD8 T cells in acute and chronic viral infection conditions can be found at https://github.com/pritykinlab/ArchVelo_notebooks
